his project is on the Marvel superhero search engine. Two APIs that have been used here are - Super Hero API and Marvel API. We have Fetched and displayed a list of Superheros (Characters) on the home page. Also created a search bar that will filter out the character based on the search query and if we press enter after typing the character name eg. 'HULK', detail of the superhero will be displayed and a list of comics will also get displayed.
